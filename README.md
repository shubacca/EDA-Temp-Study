In this exercise, a dataset of human body temperatures is analyzed using the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

- Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?
- Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?
- Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?
- Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?
- What testing approach is being used and why?
